    "Managing how to input and output data in our code is something that we have already been doing, without knowing much about what are we using. A **stream** is a buffer where we dump information during the execution of the code, and then we flush it to the corresponding output. We don't know which is the size of the information we will recieve/send. It would be like a swamp. An unknown amount of water comes, and we deliver it as needed. As for types of streams, there are two:\n",
