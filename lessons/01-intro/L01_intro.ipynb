We have previously seen the type **int**, but we never say the **char** type. A **char** is an 8 bit variable type that contains an integer for a given character (see [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com/)). The `*` after the **char** means that the variable is a pointer, and the `*` after that means the everything before is a pointer. Essentially, what we are passing as a second argument is a pointer of pointers of chars, and for now, when I say pointer, think about a vector. Which makes sense, since a word is a vector of letters, and a sentence (or all the command line arguments) is a vector of words."
