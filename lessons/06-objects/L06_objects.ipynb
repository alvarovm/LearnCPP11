    "You will read more than once that C++ is an **object oriented** programming language. This is, C++ has the ability to deal with **object** and **classes** (they are equivalent names for the same thing). An **object** is just data and operations you can perform with that data that are together within the same infrastructure. As an example, imagine we have a store, and that we want to write something to check the stock. In our store, we have several things we sell, but each thing has several properties in comon with different values:\n",
    "- Name\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "- Number of items available\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with objects in the store would be annoying without classes. If we have a **class** called `item`, we can store information about each type of item, which is the price, and how many items we have left. Actually, during this workshop, you have already used classes without knowing it, such as `vector` or `string`. "
