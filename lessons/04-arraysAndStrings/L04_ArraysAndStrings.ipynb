    "As you can see, eventhough we reserved the memory for only 3 elements, we can access the fourth and fifth element. What happened here? You have to imagine the memory of the computer as a big column of cells. When we reserve the memory for 3 elements, 3 of those cells, which are condiguous, are blocked and used only by the array we just defined. Let's see if we can visualize it better. Let's assume the pice of code:\n",

    "int a[3];\n",

We will go deeper in pointers in another lesson, so don't worry a lot about this for now. When we access `a[1]`, we tell the computer to access the memory address of `a`, `101`, and move one forward. We can obviously access the memory address `104` by calling `a[3]`, but that memory address might be used by another part of the computer, and changing it might make your computer break for ever.

    "As we probably all agree, dealing with arrays can be a little bit annoying. In C++ there is a safer and more friendly version of arrays: the **vector** structure. A vector is a class that works in the same way as an array, but it blocks accessing or modifying a memory address that is not in the vector. It also has a lot of other utilities. In order to define a vector, one needs to include the `vector` library. Also, when declaring a vector, we need to specify the type. We can also specify the size and the initial values. You can learn more in [the cplusplus vector page](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/)\n",

    "std::vector<double> c(4,0.0); // Declares a vector c of doubles with size = 4 and initializes them to 0.0.\n",

    "- `v.at(i)` or `v[i]` is the way to access the index `i` of a vector. We can read or write in there. As an example, `v[2] = 3` sets the third element to 3, and exact same result is accomplished by `v.at(2) = 3`.\n",
    "- `v.size()` is a vector function that returns the number of elements in a vector. It will return the number of elements allocated, even if they are not initialized. \n",
    "- `v.push_back(var)` will add a new element at the end of the vector with value `var`. The size will increase by 1.\n",
    "- `v.back()` returns the last element of the vector. Is equivalent to `v[v.size() - 1]`.\n",
    "- `v.pop_back()` removes the last element of a vector.\n",
    "- `v.clear()` deletes all elements\n",
    "- `v.resize(n)` changes the size of the vector to `n`. Let's see an example:\n",

    "std::vector<int> v(3,0); // Vector v has 3 elements initialized to 0\n",
