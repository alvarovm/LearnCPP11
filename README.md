## Requirements
There are no knowledge requirements to be able to follow these sets of lessons. However, familiarity with linux and jupyter notebook are required. All the notebooks will work on linux, but their usability is questioned for windows.
It is necessary that the user has gedit(linux/mac) or notepad++(windows) installed.
It is necessary that the user has g++ installed.

If you are not familiar or have never installed anaconda/miniconda, please do the following:
### Set up of the Notebook in Linux / Mac
- Download [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), and install the version with python 3.X
- Install (or make sure you have installed) g++ and gedit
- To start learning, run `jupyter notebook`, and a new tab in a browser should open. Locate your favorite lesson notebook (.ipynb files) and start!

### Set up of the Notebook in Windows
- Download [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), and install the version with python 3.X
- Download [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/), and install it
- To start learning, locate in the windows menu the program Jupyter Notebook. Navigate to the notebook you want to open, and start learning! However, if you are using WINDOWS, you will need to replace, any time it appears, the command `gedit` by the command `start notepad++`.

### Running commands in the Notebook
Inside the notebook, as you will see, there are several cells. To run the content of a cell, use `shift + enter`. A single enter will just create a new line inside the cell.

## Feedback
Any kind of feedback is welcome. If something is not working, please open an issue on github and I will happily check it out.
