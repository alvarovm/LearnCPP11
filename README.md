## Requirements
There are no knowledge requirements to be able to follow these sets of lessons. However, familiarity with linux and jupyter notebook are required. All the notebooks will work on linux, but their usability is questioned for windows.

Any kind of feedback is welcome. If something is not working, please open an issue on github and I will happily check it out.
